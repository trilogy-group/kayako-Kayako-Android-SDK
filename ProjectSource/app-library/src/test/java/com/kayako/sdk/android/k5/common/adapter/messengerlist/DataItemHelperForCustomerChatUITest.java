        - if the previous message is unread and the current message is read, add a unread message separator between the two
        - if the previous message was sent before the start of the next day and the current message was sent after the start of the new day, add a date separator

        - Ensure messages are grouped together (avatar and time behaviour) based on whether subsequent messages are sent within a time interval

        - Ensure messages are NOT grouped together if sent within time interval but by different users

        - Ensure messages are NOT grouped together if date separator is applied
        - Allow messages to be grouped together if unread separator is applied (don't enforce anything, but defines acceptable behaviour)
